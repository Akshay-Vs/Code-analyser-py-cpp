## Round 1 - Bubble sort

### Problem


1. In the provided Python code, you'll find a function named "problem" that is meant to sort an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm. However, a bug in the code is causing issues with the sorting process, **particularly when elements are swapped within a for loop.**

2. Your task is to find and fix the bug in the code without changing the function's name, parameters, or return type to ensure the function correctly sorts the array.

#### **Hint: To fix the problem in the code, you should use the Bubble Sort algorithm, which involves repeatedly swapping adjacent elements when they are in the wrong order.**

**Question:**
You are given a Python function `print_diamond_pattern(n)` that is intended to print a diamond pattern with odd numbers. However, the code contains errors that need to be corrected. Your task is to identify and fix these errors to produce the correct diamond pattern. The function signature is as follows:

```python
def print_diamond_pattern(n):
    # Your code here with errors
```

**Instructions:**
- There are two intentional logical errors in the code. Identify and fix these errors to produce the correct diamond pattern.
- The upper half of the diamond should contain consecutive odd numbers, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 in each row.
- The lower half of the diamond should also contain consecutive odd numbers, starting from the second-to-last odd number and decrementing by 2 in each row.

**Example:**
```python
print_diamond_pattern(5)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
  1
 234
56789
 234
  1
```

Feel free to try identifying and fixing the two logical errors in the provided function!
